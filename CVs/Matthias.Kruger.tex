Matthias Krüger joined the University of Stuttgart in October 2012 and is leading the
independent research group {\it Non-equilibrium Systems} located at the Max Planck Institute
for Intelligent Systems, Stuttgart. Before coming to Stuttgart, he was a postdoc at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, USA.  In 2009, he gained his Doctoral
degree as a theoretical physicist at the University of Konstanz, Germany.

He theoretically studies different aspects of nonequilibrium statistical physics, including
fluids far from equilibrium, fluctuation (Casimir) forces under nonequilibrium conditions,
as well as radiative energy transport on the nano-scale.

He recently received an Emmy Noether Grant from the German Research Foundation (DFG), a
prestigious program that allows young researchers early independence.  Before, he was
supported through other programs of DFG and Fulbright and is a regular committee member of
the German National Academic Foundation.

He published around 30 articles in peer-reviewed journals, and, including ongoing projects, supervised 2 postdocs, 1 Phd student and 3 undergraduate students.
