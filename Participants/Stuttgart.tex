{\bf Universität Stuttgart -- A Research University of International Standing:}\\
The Universität Stuttgart lies right in the centre of the largest high-tech region of Europe. We are surrounded by a number of renowned research facilities and have such global players as Daimler or IBM as our neighbours. We were founded in 1829 and over the years this technical institution has developed to the research intensive university that it is today. Our main emphasis is on engineering and the natural sciences.
%
Indicators of our excellent status are the two projects that were successful in the recent {\it Excellence Initiative} sponsored by both the Federal and the State governments. One project is the Cluster of Excellence {\it Simulation Technology} and the other, the Graduate School {\it Advanced Manufacturing Engineering}.

{\bf Experience with EU research funding:}\\
The University of Stuttgart has extensive experience with the various funding programs of the European Commission and has been the {\it leading German university in FP6}, both in number of projects (184) and in terms of funding (54 Mio. \euro). In FP7, it was yet again {\it among the most successful German universities} with 246 projects funded and a total budget of 94 Mio. \euro. The University has consistently been involved in Marie-Curie-projects in previous framework programs. In FP7, it participated in 13 Marie Curie actions.
