\begin{wpdescription}
%In equilibrium, information about the macroscopic state of a medium can be deduced via
%rather simple measurement procedures using simple probes and then be summarized in an
%equation of state.
%
%In the future, something similar may become possible even far from equilibrium, and
%revolutionize our technological abilities, but this will require much more sophisticated
%probing and analysing procedures that are not yet generally understood.
%
Far from equilibrium, fluctuations are non-universal and standard thermodynamic notions,
such as temperature and pressure, become ambiguous.
This has many unintuitive practical consequences, which defy conventional thermodynamic
wisdom and potentially invalidate standard technological procedures.
%
For example, a colloidal particle in a non-isothermal solvent cannot be used for Brownian thermometry 
in the conventional way \cite{rings-etal:2010,kroy:2014}. In theory, we have shown how to overcome this problem
in terms of a frequency-dependent noise temperature \cite{falasco-etal:2014}.
%
We want to validate this experimentally and to see to what extent something similar can be achieved for other 
nonequilibria, e.g. in active-particle suspensions.
%
Further, far from equilibrium, the mechanical pressure on a mesoscopic probe will generally depend on the range and 
symmetry of the medium-probe interactions. 
%
We want to elucidate this within a many-body theory of ``dry active matter'' \cite{solon-etal:2015}, 
to which we successively add elements of ``wet reality'' \cite{zoettl-stark:2014}.
%
Similarly, motile proteins and motors in a living cell affect the function
of its constituents by what  we call ``active crowding'', in analogy with the much studied ``molecular crowding''. 
%
Any biopolymer in a living cell actually represents a smart probe that scans its environment with its many 
degrees of freedom \cite{otto-etal:2013}.
%
We could account for the effect of quenched static crowding by a parameter renormalization \cite{schoebl-etal:2014}.  
%
Here we ask: can something similar be achieved for active crowding?

\begin{tasklist}

\begin{task}[title=Nonequilibrium equations of state (NEOS),id=task1,PM=8,lead=ULEI,partners={UNIPD,USTUTT},
wphases=0-48!0.5]
Phase diagrams and equations of states are fundamental tools in material construction.
We consider active-particle suspensions together with the group in Padova (exchange of personel), 
which will provide essential expert knowledge on nonequilibrium response theory.
%
Starting from a many-body Langevin equation with individual propulsion forces for the
particles of the active fluid \cite{solon-etal:2015}, we let it interact perturbatively with colloidal probes to
deduce their effective friction kernels, induced mutual interactions, non-gradient forces, and a possible breaking of
the action-reaction principle.  
%
Nonequilibrium response theory (as theoretically developed in the Leuven-Padova-Prague nodes) lets us include 
frenetic contributions in the response functions \cite{baiesi-wynants:2009} and to the mechanical pressure 
exerted by an active fluid on a probe. 
%
Geometric symmetries (tacitly) imposed in previous approaches will be relaxed and realistic particle-probe interactions, 
as appropriate for the hot Janus particles studied in our experiments and simulations, will be introduced.
%
To clarify how active-particle suspensions are fundamentally different from externally driven systems,
we will compare our particle-based approach to the field theoretical approach pursued in Stuttgart (exchange of personel). 

\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Active Crowding,id=task2,lead=ULEI,partners={KUL},wphases=0-48!0.5]
A lack of understanding how the activity in a living cell affects the physical behavior
of its constituents severely limit first-principles approaches to living systems and 
innovative technologies involving active matter.
Pioneering attempts predict enhanced diffusion due to hydrodynamic interactions \cite{mikhailov-kapral:2015}.
%
We want to consider that motors or other sources of nonequilibrium do often act directly on cytoskeletal 
polymers and their weak transient networks that may get disrupted and investigate how three different types of active
crowding affect the fluctuation spectrum and non-linear nonequilibrium dynamics of a 
semiflexible test polymer \cite{otto-etal:2013}:
an attached laser-heated metal nanoparticle tracer; power strokes of molecular
motors inducing backbone tension spikes; ``inelastic''  \cite{gralka-kroy:2015}
unbinding of weak (cytoskeletal) bonds under arbitrarily fast dynamic loading \cite{bullerjahn-sturm-kroy:2014}.
%
This may have interesting conceptual consequences for mechanical homeostasis, i.e., how cells and tissues bear up against 
their own activity.   

\end{task}


\begin{task}[title=Noise Temperature,id=task3,lead=ULEI,wphases=0-24!0.5]
Emerging metal-nanoparticle tracking and trapping technologies and nanoscopic Brownian heat engines
operate far from the isothermal limit.
We want to test recent predictions for non-isothermal Brownian motion \cite{rings-etal:2010,falasco-etal:2014}, 
beyond the Markov limit. Therefore, we need to adapt the theory 
to our massively parallel numerical simulations \cite{chakraborty-etal:2011}, 
which use (highly compressible) Lennard--Jones solvents.
Experimentally, this requires to follow the fluctuations of 
a heated Brownian particle on a nanosecond timescale and picometer spatial resolution, which has
\emph{even in equilibrium} only recently become possible  \cite{kheifets-etal:2014}.
%
A dedicated optical trap with dual beam heating and a detection bandwidth of about 50 MHz
will therefore be newly constructed. 
%
This will e.g.\ allow the classical method of Brownian thermometry to be extended to media far from equilibrium.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Active-Particle Suspensions,id=task4,lead=ULEI,wphases=24-48!0.5]
Technological applications of active-particle suspensions  are
currently severely hampered by a lack of control over these systems.
%
We have recently established innovative force-free control systems, so-called photon nudging
and thermophoretic trapping technologies \cite{Qian2013,Braun:NanoLetters:2015}, which deliberately exploit 
the nonequilibrium transport caused by non-isothermal conditions.
%
Using them in our experiments with hot Janus particles, and accompanying "all-atom" molecular-dynamics 
simulations \cite{chakraborty-etal:2011}, will allow for a continuous tuning of the strength of 
the activity and confinement to target failures of thermodynamic bulk-pressure equations of
state \cite{ginot-etal:2015}.
